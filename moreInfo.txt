================

<Description of what you have accomplished>

	Created a mass spring class that contains all the logic for the jello cube and incline plane
	Calculates the hook force, damping force for the structural, shear and bend springs
	Calculates the force field
	Calculates the collision with the inclined plane and bounding box
	Using calculated forces, we find the acceleration, which is integator using either Euler or RK4 to find the position

<Also, explain any extra credit that you have implemented.>

	1. Transparent jelly cube
	2. Inclined plane
	3. Modified world file: final.w to create a more elastic jelly
	4. Procedural texture: checkered ground plane
	5. FPS display using VegaFEM library: performanceCounter.h
